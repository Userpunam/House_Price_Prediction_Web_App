We Developed  a flask web Application for House Price Prediction Using a machine Learning Model 
Here our task is to create a flask-Based web application thar predicts house prices based on input features using a machine learning model.
we  can use any open â€“ source housing price dataset and a simple model algorithm , preferably implementing the model algorithm ourself .
This repository contains the code for a Flask-based web application that predicts house prices based on input features. The prediction is powered by a machine learning model that has been trained on an open-source housing price dataset.
