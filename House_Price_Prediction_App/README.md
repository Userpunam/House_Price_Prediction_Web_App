# House Price Prediction

This Flask web application predicts house prices based on user inputs. The model is trained on an open-source housing dataset. Here  we Develop a flask web Application for House Price Prediction Using a machine Learning Model 
Our  task is to create a flask-Based web application thar predicts house prices based on input features using a machine learning model. We use any open â€“ source housing price dataset and a simple model algorithm , preferably implementing the model algorithm ourself . The final deliverable should be a  GitHub repository containing the code ,documentation , and setup steps .
